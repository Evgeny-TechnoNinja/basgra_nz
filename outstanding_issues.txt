Short list of known issues/to do

Issues

- 64-bit R won't run the DLL properly so need to use 32-bit R
- R memory overflow with output object from lonmg chains
- burnin setting not working correctly in BayesianTools::runMCMC()
- fix bar plot width vanishing in data docx reports
- Northland soil moisture is from different site/soil than trial
- daylength effects too severe in model
- LERG LERV hardcoded with no calibration
- root depth poorly identified
- litter decomposition not linked to soil parameters
- too many soil parameters
- CRES is unstable, poorly determined 

To Do

- calculate RMSE and NSE for model fits and print on output charts
- reorganise scripts so separate script not needed for each site
- calculate additional posterior predictions with modified inputs/parameters
