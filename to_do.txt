BASGRA Scott Farm  Calibration To Do List

* How to handle pseudostem. -> It's there but not counted.
* Fit blocks separately?
* Lincoln data
* Post grazing dissection data from Katherine Tozer. Adjust harvest % by fraction.
* Darren.Kriticos@csiro.au population model DYMEX
* Do we want APSIM-AgPasture? Ask Iris.
* Nicer parameter handling.
* Vernalisation model required.
* Check uncertainty bounds 
* Look at BC parameters and adjust bounds to hit higher growth rate.
* Plot residuals

Finalise how to compare model to data.  What year are we going to calibrate/compare?
Fit blocks separately (BASGRA can do this)
Average across blocks?
Calibrate to one block and validate on another?
(this validates both the model and the data - quite demanding)
Fit statistics (GRMSE)/visualisation

Organise parameters, maybe write a script for this to allow easier documentation?
I guess all 81 parameters always need to be there?

Organise calibration parameters - 
I guess you only put in what paramaters you want to vary? Try to reduce size of param space
Sensible priors

Additions to model:
- vernalisation (TILG should have short season only) Take mechanism from another model?
- decomposition (already in new version)
- establishment and loss of vigor
