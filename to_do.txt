BASGRA Scott Farm  Calibration To Do List

How to handle establishment year in data

Finalise how to compare model to data.  What year are we going to calibrate/compare?
Average across blocks?
Calibrate to one block and validate on another?
(this validates both the model and the data - quite demanding)
Fit statistics (GRMSE)/visualisation

Increase to 2017 to get soil water data. Get weather

Organise parameters, maybe write a script for this to allow easier documentation?
I guess all 81 parameters always need to be there?

Organise calibration parameters - 
I guess you only put in what paramaters you want to vary? Try to reduce size of param space
Sensible priors

Additions to model:
- vernalisation
- decomposition
- establishment and loss of vigor
