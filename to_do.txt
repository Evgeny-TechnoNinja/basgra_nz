BASGRA Scott Farm  Calibration To Do List

How to handle establishment year in data? 

* How to handle pseudostem. Asked Marcel. No LAI?

* Combine block data. Define a nominal grazing date (or number) to group by.

* Lincoln data

Finalise how to compare model to data.  What year are we going to calibrate/compare?
Average across blocks?
Calibrate to one block and validate on another?
(this validates both the model and the data - quite demanding)
Fit statistics (GRMSE)/visualisation

Organise parameters, maybe write a script for this to allow easier documentation?
I guess all 81 parameters always need to be there?

Organise calibration parameters - 
I guess you only put in what paramaters you want to vary? Try to reduce size of param space
Sensible priors

Additions to model:
- vernalisation (TILG should have short season only) Take mechanism from another model?
- decomposition
- establishment and loss of vigor
